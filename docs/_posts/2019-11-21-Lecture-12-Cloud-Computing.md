_The Cloud_
* Virtualised Services
* Virtual machines spawned on demand
* Locations of services not certain
* Similar to network 'cloud'
* Cloud is like a transparent layer that client's don't see

**Flavours of Cloud Computing**
* Traditional IT: responsible for everything
* Infrastructure aaS: Cloud provides networking, storage, hardware, virtualisation
* Platform aaS: Cloud manages operating system, databases, security etc. - you only have to provide application
* Software aaS: Entire stack managed by cloud

* Characteristics of Cloud Computing
	* On-demand, self-service
	* Network accessible
	* Pooled resources (multi-tenant pool of resources, dynamically reassigned per customer demand)
	* Elasticity (rapid scalability)
	* Measured service (monitor/billed for resources used)
